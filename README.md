# Virtual Internship With Carbon (Formerly "Paylater")
This repository contains notebooks on analyzing financial data during my virtual internship with "Paylater" (now Carbon) financial institution. My experience with this internship was between February 2019 and April 2019.

## üë®üèΩ‚Äçüíª About The Notebooks

### [Notebook Here](https://github.com/NonMundaneDev/carbon-arise-internship/blob/main/Arise_Internship_Application_Challenge.ipynb)

The Arise application challenge notebook contains the solution I came up with for the entry-level virtual internship role at Carbon (then "Paylater"). As described in the markdown texts of the notebook, we were challenged perform some data cleaning and wrangling on anonymized customer loan data and provide necessary insights based on the data exploration, as a means to scale through the first phase of the virtual internship.

This notebook contains a breif solution I came up with based on a task given to me by the Data Scientist in-charge of managing interns. In the notebook, I used principal component analysis (unsupervised learning) technique to segment customers with disapproved loan requests based on some given numeric features such as their 'income', 'age', 'number of weeks they last applied for a loan', and other sensitively defined features.

The business goal of this task was to see if we could use the PCA technqiue among other unsupervised learning techniques to find patterns among rejected loan applications and see whether the business can take any operational action accordingly.

## üíª Data Availability
The data for this project is not provided because it is mostly in-house, including metadata and the data dictionary.

## ‚öí Skills Gained
During my time as a virtual intern, I learned and used the following technologies;
- Pandas (for data wrangling),
- Google Cloud Source Repositories,
- Google Cloud BigQuery,
- Ingesting with large, enterprise-level data.
